# V JVM
> A Java Virtual Machine implmentation written in V Lang.

## Disclaimer

This version of JVM implementation does not responsible for real life application hosting,
it is only a prove of V's real life application attempt.

For complete support of JVM, you should download from OpenJDK or Orcale official website.

Notice that Java 8 is almost outdated, I highly recommended uses Java 17.
